To share my skills with my network
This analysis is based on the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consist of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. 
Also there is another dataset related to world happiness report which is an annual publication of the UN. These 2 datasets will be mergedto see if
there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
